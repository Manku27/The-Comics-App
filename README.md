# Comics App 📚🦸

Welcome to **Comics App**, a unique platform tailored for comic book readers and collectors to organize, manage, and even trade their comic book collections. This app aims to provide an unparalleled experience for comic enthusiasts, offering detailed cataloging options and community-driven features that go beyond just reading lists.

## 🚀 Objective
There is currently no curated service specifically designed for comic book readers and collectors to manage their inventories. Comics App fills this gap by:
- Helping users manage their comic collections.
- Offering a public inventory feature to facilitate trades and group discounts.
- Providing insights for sellers to understand precise market demands.

Goodreads exists for books, but comic books deserve a better, customized experience. 📖✨
